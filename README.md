# success_vs_age
A short project to answer the question: is there a relationship between age and the success of tech start-up?

According to these articles (https://hbr.org/2018/07/research-the-average-age-of-a-successful-startup-founder-is-45 and https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/a-study-of-27-million-startups-found-ideal-age-to-start-a-business-and-its-much-older-than-you-think.html), the average age of high-tech founders falls in the early forties.

Entrepreneurs in their 30s and 40s (between Gen Y and Boomers) have been thought to be in their prime for business success. Theyâ€™ve got that supposedly-perfect balance between youth and experience.

But is that a true claim? 

In this short project, I will use some web scrapping techniques to extract birth dates of several CEOs of successful tech companies.
